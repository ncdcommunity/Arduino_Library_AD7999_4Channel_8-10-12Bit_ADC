#AD7999

The AD7999 is an I2C programmable resolution quad-channel analog to digital converter, capable of processing 22,500 samples per second.nd 10,000ppm.The AD7999 uses a 5V reference voltage for all 4 input channels; however, the last channel may be sacrificed to serve as an external reference voltage input. The AD7999 has a fixed I2C address of 0x29, allowing one device per I2C port.
